- 3.2mm holes for M3 bolts - In V2, these will be higher resolution
- 5mm holes for M5 bolts - In V2, these will be 5.2mm and higher resolution
- 2.9mm holes for screwing M3 bolts into plastic - In V2, this will be replaced by a circle with tabs
- Not all M3 bolts require being screwed into something (i.e. secured by gravity) - In V2, all parts will be properly secured
- For overhanging holes, there are 1mm in-built bridges which must be punctured with a screwdriver, etc - In V2, these will higher resolution
- In general, parts are oriented correctly for printing without supports - In V2, breakaway in-built supports will be replaced by supportless holes
- Circular overhangs may droop
- In V2, tight fit holes will have tiny notches to prevent seam line interferance
