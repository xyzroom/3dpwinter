- 3.2mm holes for M3 bolts
- 5mm holes for M5 bolts
- 2.9mm holes for screwing M3 bolts into plastic
- Not all M3 bolts require being screwed into something (i.e. secured by gravity)
- For overhanging holes, there are 1mm in-built bridges which must be punctured with a screwdriver, etc
- In general, parts are oriented correctly for printing without supports
- Supports may be required for steep overhangs on larger circular holes that have normals parallel to the horizontal plane, but usually some droop is tolerable with post-processing
