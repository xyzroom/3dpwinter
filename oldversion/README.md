# oldversion (pre dec2024)
## Comments
These are older version files for a machine that works technically works. This was the initial version built to print new parts to upgrade itself.  
- The old x carriage had issues gripping onto the linear bearings and flexed under belt tension. The new x carriage clamps on the bearings and is not missing so much material.
- The new hot end mount grips onto the E3D V6 cooling fins using a zip tie for added stability.
- The new y carriages clamp onto the x linear rods, adding stability.
- The y rod/roller mounts are now more reliable to align with the frame.
- Some distances have been changed, with some yet to change
